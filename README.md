Step 1: Pull the base image from the official Splunk Enterprise repository

Open a terminal window on your local machine.
Run the following command to pull the base image from the official Splunk Enterprise repository:
```go
docker pull splunk/splunk-enterprise:latest
```
This command will download the latest available version of the Splunk Enterprise image from the official repository.

Step 2: Create a new Dockerfile

Create a new file named Dockerfile in a directory on your local machine.
Add the following lines to the Dockerfile:
```go
FROM splunk/splunk-enterprise:latest
```
This line tells Docker to use the Splunk Enterprise image as the base image for your container.

Step 3: Build the Docker image

Save the Dockerfile and navigate to the directory where it's located.
Run the following command to build the Docker image:
```go
docker build -t my-splunk-image .
```
This command tells Docker to build an image with the name my-splunk-image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

Step 4: Push the Docker image to Artifactory

Assuming you have an Artifactory account, log in to your Artifactory instance using the artifactory command-line client.
Run the following command to push the Docker image to Artifactory:
```go
artifactory push my-splunk-image artifactory://<your-artifactory-domain>/virtual/splunk-images
```
Replace <your-artifactory-domain> with your actual Artifactory domain name. This command will upload the my-splunk-image image to the splunk-images virtual repository in Artifactory.

Step 5: Debug the performance

To debug the performance of the Dockerized Splunk environment, you can run some basic tests to measure its performance. For example, you can use tools like curl or wget to test the response time of the Splunk web interface.

You can also use Docker Compose to start multiple containers and simulate a distributed Splunk environment. For example:

```go
version: '3'
services:
  splunk:
    image: my-splunk-image
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on: 
      - redis
redis:
    image: redis:alpine
        ports:
          - "6379:6379"
```
    
This Docker Compose file defines two services: splunk and redis. The splunk service uses the my-splunk-image image and maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 in the container. The redis service uses the redis:alpine image and maps port 6379 on the host machine to port 6379 in the container.

Once you've defined your Docker Compose file, you can run the following command to start the containers:
```go
docker compose up -d
```
This command starts the containers in detached mode, so you can close your terminal window without interrupting the containers.

Now you can use tools like curl or wget to test the response time of the Splunk web interface. For example:
```go
curl http://localhost:8000
```
This command sends an HTTP request to the Splunk web interface running on port 8000 and measures the response time.
